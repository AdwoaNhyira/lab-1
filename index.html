        <p>My name is Adwoa Nhyira Attafuah-Wadee, a university student from Ghana. I am a junior in Ashesi University, located at Berekuso in the Eastern Region of Ghana. I am majoring in Management Information Systems (MIS), which is a study of information systems and their use in businesses and other organizations. I have a wide variety of interests ranging from singing to swimming, from social media marketing to web development, and from travelling to simply lazying about. There's so much I want to achieve in terms of my career and interests, and I am driven to fulfill them one step at a time. </p>
